          <Paragraph>
            A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by
            cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or
            double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based
            on blockchain technologyâ€”a distributed ledger enforced by a
            disparate network of computers. A defining feature of
            cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any
            central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government
            interference or manipulation.{" "}
          </Paragraph>

          <Title level={3}>How secure is Crypto Currency?</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            Cryptocurrencies are usually built using blockchain technology.
            Blockchain describes the way transactions are recorded into "blocks"
            and time stamped. It iss a fairly complex, technical process, but
            the result is a digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that
            is hard for hackers to tamper with. In addition, transactions
            require a two-factor authentication process. For instance, you might
            be asked to enter a username and password to start a transaction.
            Then, you might have to enter an authentication code that is sent
            via text to your personal cell phone. While securities are in place,
            that does not mean cryptocurrencies are un-hackable. In fact,
            several high-dollar hacks have cost cryptocurrency startups heavily.
            Hackers hit Coincheck to the tune of $534 million and BitGrail for
            $195 million in 2018. That made them two of the biggest
            cryptocurrency hacks of 2018,
